## Project 1 -- Markov Decision Process control of robot in a 2D grid world
### Deliverables:
- MDP System
- Planning 
- Policy Iteration
- Value Iteration

## Project 2 -- RRT-based planer for getting a non-holonomic Robot to desired goal states
### Deliverables:
- Trajectory planning of a tank-drive robot
- Implemented an RRT planner for generating trajectories given a special initial state and a desired goal region
- Visualized RRT evolution
- Compared performance of RRT* algorithm on the planner vs. original RRT planner used previously

## Project 3 -- Kalman Filtering (KF) for Robot state-estimation
### Deliverables:
- Two-wheeled robot with microcontroller in both ideal state and real state considered
- Mathematical setup of the robot in a rectangular space:
- Create a Kalman Filter based state estimator to generate a state estimate, based on motor commands and sensor measurements
- Implemented an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF)
- Evaluate the algorithms in simulated environments
