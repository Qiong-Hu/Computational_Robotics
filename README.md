## [Project 1: Markov Decision Process (MDP) control of robot in a 2D grid world](https://github.com/Qiong-Hu/Computational_Robotics/tree/master/lab_1)
### Content:
- MDP System
- Planning 
- Policy Iteration
- Value Iteration

## [Project 2: RRT-based planer for getting a non-holonomic robot to target states](https://github.com/Qiong-Hu/Computational_Robotics/tree/master/lab_2)
### Content:
- Trajectory planning of a tank-drive robot
- Implemented an RRT planner for generating trajectories given a special initial state and a desired goal region
- Visualized RRT evolution
- Compared performance of RRT* algorithm on the planner vs. original RRT planner used previously

## [Project 3: Kalman Filtering (KF) for robot state-estimation](https://github.com/Qiong-Hu/Computational_Robotics/tree/master/lab_3)
### Content:
- Two-wheeled robot with microcontroller in both ideal state and real state considered
- Mathematical setup of the robot in a rectangular space:
- Create a Kalman Filter based state estimator to generate a state estimate, based on motor commands and sensor measurements
- Implemented an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)
- Evaluate the algorithms in simulated environments
